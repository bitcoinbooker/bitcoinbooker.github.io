### Company: Bitcoinbooker
### URL: https://bitcoinbooker.net
### What they claim to do: Exchange Bitcoins to Paypal USD

Bitcoinbooker claims to provide a Bitcoin to Paypal exchange service, but in reality, they are a fraudulent scam operation that uses Google advertising to catch their pray.

### How they get you:

They HIDE the fact that they have a $500 or .5 BTC Minimum deposit and if you send them anything less than $500, they will not give you a refund.

The required minimum is vaguely stated deeply hidden in their fine print here, they said it's line item No. 26-C

They're so low budget that they didn't even proofread their Terms of Service / Contract, and they have two items listed as 26-C.  When I told them they had a typo, they didn't respond and still haven't updated their website to simply change one letter C to a D.

First of all, especially for a company that provides consumer financial services, their IT systems/website should instill confidence in the consumer by working properly.  Their website is a thin dummy site and doesn't function like it is supposed to.

To be specific, when you send them money, the balance should reflect in your account.  Imagine buying something from Amazon, Ebay, any legit site, but your purchase or any evidence of your transaction, NEVER showing up anywhere.  Or imagine making a deposit into your Paypal account and the system never showing your deposit.

Since I couldn't find any reviews of them online, instead of the actual amount I needed to get exchanged, I only sent them a few hundred dollars worth of Bitcoins to make sure they were a legit operation before moving forward with the full amount.

Sure enough, after sending them the money, I patiently waited for their system to reflect my balance which should be what I just sent them and should have been instant, but it never updated so I emailed them to ask why my balance still showed 0, the email I got from them was this (the actual cut and pasted text)

Regardless of whether or not they have a minimum dollar amount, the system should still show what I've sent so far and then maybe how much more I need to send to make the minimum required deposit.  But since they are a low budget fraud operation, their system doesn't even show money you've deposited.

And since the minimum required deposit amount is completely hidden, they should offer a refund.  There is no company that I've ever heard of that will accept hundreds of dollars from a customer, and then not offer a refund in the event there is a misunderstanding, but especially when it's painfully obvious that their minimum required amount is completely hidden.

So the bottom line is that your money is held hostage until you give in to their demand of the $500 minimum.

This obviously left a very bad taste in my mouth so I couldn't get myself to send them the remainder to see if they were a legit operation, and keep in mind my balance was STILL NOT SHOWING in my account which made it that much more sketchy to send them even more money to see if they were legitimate.

I was furious and sent them a few emails requesting my funds to be refunded, and I finally got this email from “Mark”

Hi,

Please reconfirm your Wallet address.

I will send the BTC to your wallet on Monday morning as soon as back to office. (London time)

Sincerely
Mark

Of course I never received any refund from them which is why I feel the need to spread the word about this company.  Had they given me a refund, I would have simply considered them to have poor advertising practices and would not have wasted my time to post negative reviews, but they didn't so I am.

I don't know why they don't post their minimum requirement policy clearly up front so they can avoid bad reviews and making people really angry, but the only reasonable answer I can think of is the same reason they don't fix the typo on the TOS which is that they only built the site for temporary scams, so they simply don't care.  At $500 or more per customer who falls into their fraud trap, it seems like they could afford to fix a typo, but I think the reason people are frauders in the first place is because they are too lazy to do the right thing.

I think movies that reflect criminals who create elaborately planned bank heists, are just that, movies and in reality, criminals are fundamentally lazy which is why they are criminals to begin with and why they don't even fix the typo I pointed out.  For a financial company to have a typo on their main Terms of Service and refuse to fix it, on top of having an IT system that doesn't even reflect the money their customers have sent them, is beyond my comprehension.

Lastly, since you have to send them money via Bitcoin, I don't think it's an easy task to track them down since Bitcoins are supposed to be somewhat anonymous and un-trackable and they are not based in the US. 

### Main Redflags:

- Their domain name is only registered for 1 year.
- They don't have a US Phone number but advertise in the US.
- A US phone number would cost next to nothing.
- Don't fix a one letter typo after being informed of the typo.
- I can't find any reviews of this company online.
- They do not give refunds for any reason, even though it costs them nothing to do so.
- All of the numbers on their home page that show successful transactions, ARE FAKE.  How could a system that can't even show the users balance, be so sophisticated that it would show the transaction histories on their home page?  Not a chance.

### I hope this review will help others avoid getting trapped or scammed by this poor excuse of a company (or fraud/scam whatever it is).

Even in the highly unlikely event that this company isn't a fraud, they don't have the technical chops to protect your money or even avoid losing your money due to their incompetence.  A company that can't even make their system reflect your balance, will surely hurt a lot of people soon enough.  

I'm an entrepreneur, so having an unorganized startup is understandable in my opinion, as long as they don't steal anyone's money, offer full refunds, act ethically, etc. but this company is not that in my opinion, and shouldn't be allowed to practice any type of financial service business.
